##  Hypothetical Improvement Plan and Team Effort in Response to Sprint 2 Feedback

### Introduction
In response to the feedback received for Sprint 2, our team faced significant time constraints due to overlapping final 
exams and other course pressures. Despite these challenges, we demonstrated commitment and made concerted efforts to address the 
feedback within the limited time frame.

### Unit Tests and Module Interface Alignment

Hypothetical Action Plan: Ideally, we would have realigned our unit tests with each module interface to ensure comprehensive 
coverage as well as made changes to them based on the feedback from sprint 2 as this was a shortcoming for us in sprint 1. We 
believed we had achieved what was desired in this area and that our unit tests were up to the standards of the assignment.

Actual Effort: Due to feedback being released when it did, we were unable to make the changes necessary based on feedback.

### Kanban Board and Issue Tracker Management

We didn’t realize there were any issues with our Kanban board. While we did receive most marks, we lost some due to not 
being specific enough and not including backlog entries. We did have backlog entries but they were converted into tasks 
between our Sprint 2 submission.

### Enhanced Code Review Policy

Hypothetical Action Plan: Our goal was to establish clearer code review policies, focusing on thoroughness and unit test coverage.

Actual Effort: With the coding part already completed, further code reviews were not possible. However, we did engage in 
discussions to acknowledge our shortcomings and understand better practices.

### Distinction in Process Model Analysis

Hypothetical Action Plan: We aimed to refine our process model analysis to align more closely with the feedback.

Actual Effort: We worked to refine our process model analysis. However, due to the feedback being released later, we 
could not fully achieve the level of improvement desired.

### Performance Reviews

We did try to be more critical in our performance reviews but we really didn’t have too many issues as a group. We also 
didn’t realize we were going to lose as many marks in this area as we believed and still do believe our reviews accurately 
represent each other’s efforts.

### SOLID

We tried to follow the Single-Responsibility and Open-Closed principle, but we didn’t get to explore the 
Interface-Segregation-Principle or the Dependency-Inversion-Principle. We would’ve explored and applied the other principles 
of SOLID if we had additional time. Open-Closed Principle and Single-Responsibility could have been improved as we did not 
perfectly follow these principles due to a lack of insight of the bottle framework and HTTPS request separation.

### Demonstrating Commitment Amidst Challenges
Despite the intense pressures of final exams, we held four meetings over Discord, reflecting our serious commitment 
to the course and the project.

Our discussions focused on identifying areas for improvement and strategizing how to address them in the limited time 
available.

We made a concentrated effort to align our work with the feedback, but were constrained by the time limitations and the 
completion of certain project phases.

### Conclusion

Our team's response to the feedback for Sprint 2 was marked by a strong commitment to improvement under challenging circumstances. 
While we were unable to implement all the desired changes due to the overlap with final exams and the completed state of certain project 
components, our efforts during this period demonstrate our dedication and willingness to learn and improve. This experience has been valuable 
in understanding the practical challenges of project management and teamwork under pressure.
