# Project Progress and Approach:
Our team has made significant progress in developing the Performance Review web-based app. 
Turjo has successfully set up the server, enabling seamless communication for our application. 
Daniel has constructed the HTML and implemented a robust templating engine, providing a foundation for the app's frontend logic. 
Caleb has established the data store and object mapping, crucial for managing and organizing our application's data.
Tanjeet has been instrumental in developing user info and security features, focusing on safeguarding user data and access. 

Currently, we have a functional server and a structured HTML layout for the application. 
Connections between various components are established, allowing us to access essential user information through the implemented logic.


* During our SCRUM meetings, we consistently present and discuss code contributions. The entire team is informed about the progress and actively participates in discussions.

* We have prioritized adherence to SOLID principles and de-coupling to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.

* Before merging any code, a comprehensive review is conducted. We did this to catch potential issues and validate the code.

* We have successfully established and enforced pull request deadlines. 

# Future Plans:
Moving forward, we plan to collaboratively work on the application's logic to integrate the server functionality with the HTML structure.
We will implement the app's logic, and focus on user information and security features.

# Project Progress and Approach:

In the first sprint of our Performance Review web-based app, we've successfully completed all the initial requirements. 
Our application now boasts a fully functional database where users can create their accounts, ensuring that no duplicate 
usernames are allowed. Users can log in securely with their credentials and access their personal review page. All published 
reviews are displayed on the public review page.

This sprint served as our project's foundational setup. It was a learning experience where we had to grasp several new concepts.

We operated as a team of four, as one member had to drop the course, but we are now well-prepared for the upcoming sprints.

Caleb skillfully handled the database setup, ensuring its reliability. Daniel crafted all the necessary HTML files and
contributed significantly to the logic. Turjo managed the routing and made substantial contributions to unit testing.
Tanjeet played a pivotal role in building the logic and maintaining documentation.

We meticulously followed our professor's guidelines throughout the process, conducting regular code reviews. Each team
member actively participated in the development, and all pull requests underwent thorough review. We upheld the principles
of SOLID and de-coupling, which were emphasized in our class.

# Future Plans:
As we progress into the next sprint, our focus is on enhancing the database to make it more sophisticated. We plan to
introduce the ability for users to save multiple drafts, adding more features to the public review page, and improving 
the overall user-friendliness of the web app. With the successful completion of the foundational sprint, we're well-prepared 
to tackle these more advanced tasks and create a robust, feature-rich application.
