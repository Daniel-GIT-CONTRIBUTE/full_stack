# Process Model Diagram:

 # Elements of Process
 * Team meetings: Our team planned ahead and conducted meetings after every class to discuss the task assignments for group members. We selected a note-taker and scrum master. The note taker took notes on the progress since our last meeting. We discussed the professor's suggestions and topics. We also reviewed each team member's code and took note of any difficulties they faced. At the end of our meeting, we made final decisions and approved/denied pull requests.
 
 * Scrum Cycles: Our goal for the scrum cycles was to develop and complete sprint backlog items. Backlog: We started with our Kanban board backlog items. New features and tasks: All team members agreed on implementing new features from the to-do list. 
* Task assignment: After choosing the features, we assigned tasks fairly to team members and set deadlines for committing and making pull requests, which were part of our sprint.
*Code/task implementation: Team members worked on their tasks and reported any difficulties during team meetings, requesting help from other team members.
* Pull request and code reviews: Our team then reviewed and provided constructive feedback to each other and proceeded with accepting pull requests.
* Areas of development: Code review led to improving the code and providing a better interface design.
  # Old process and comparison to new process
 Our old process lacked code reviews and deadlines during the first sprint. In our second cycle, we implemented deadlines, which really helped us deliver on time and finish by the deadline. In our current process, our team made several commits on time and received feedback from team members, resulting in significant improvements. 
 
 # Ideas and areas of improvement
 There are several ideas and areas of improvement for our team in the next cycle. For instance, we can provide a better Readme file to understand our task assignments and project description. Our Readme file will include a better explanation of where to find specific files and how our code works.
