# Sprint 3

## Performance review by Daniel Cho
I am pleased working with my teammates and how the project turned out in the end.

Turjo has been a great teammate and good communicator, when we started getting slow, 
he would get us back on track be being outspoken about what we had to do.
Criticism: please update meeting notes earlier. 

Caleb has shown a deep passion and interest in learning. He is greatly motivated and responsible.
He replies back to messages immediately. He is readily available, and a great teammate!
Extremely nitpicky Criticism: Please learn how to use cloud drives like Google Drive.  

Tanjet has shown imrpovements this sprint in participation. He wrote more code and actively asked out what he can help around with.
He showed a great deal of cooperation. Not in sprint3, but overall, it would be great if he could attend more meetings. He was not very present during sprint1 and to a lesser degree during sprint2.  


## Final Sprint Performance Review by Tridib Paul Turjo


As we approach the final stage of our project journey, it's essential to reflect on our final sprint and the overall progress we've made as a team. The final sprint brought its own set of challenges and highlights, and it's crucial to acknowledge each team member's contributions and the improvements we've collectively made.

Daniel continued to be an asset to the team during the final sprint. His expertise in HTML development and his willingness to help others was evident. However, as we neared the project deadline, Daniel experienced some anxiety and frustration, which occasionally affected his interactions with the team. Nonetheless, his sense of responsibility, teamwork, and commitment remained unwavering. He consistently assisted me when I faced challenges in understanding certain aspects of HTML, which was greatly appreciated.

Caleb maintained his exceptional level of dedication throughout the final sprint. His work on restructuring the database for improved efficiency was a significant undertaking that ultimately benefited our project. However, one area for improvement was his speed in updating meeting notes, which occasionally lagged.Caleb has been consistently easy to access and maintain constant communication with, which has greatly facilitated our collaborative efforts and project progress. Nevertheless, his proactive involvement and commitment to the project were consistent and valuable

Tanjeet demonstrated remarkable growth during the final sprint. His increased participation in team meetings and improved communication skills were noteworthy improvements. Unlike earlier sprints, Tanjeet was present at all meetings during this final phase, which significantly contributed to a more collaborative team dynamic. However, he could work on enhancing his documentation skills, aiming for more thorough and elaborate documentation, which would contribute significantly to our project's success.
Challenges in the final sprint included managing the last-minute feedback and making substantial changes to our documentation, such as component structure and process analysis according to feedback. Given that each team member had other courses and final exams to manage simultaneously, it was challenging to find convenient meeting times. To mitigate this, we leveraged Discord for most of our meetings, which proved to be an efficient solution. I'd like to commend everyone for their dedication and effort in completing the project amid these challenges.

In conclusion, our team has shown remarkable growth and adaptability throughout the entire project. While we faced some challenges in the final sprint, our collective efforts and determination allowed us to overcome them. I appreciate each team member's contributions, and I believe we can consider this project a success, thanks to our teamwork and commitment. I look forward to seeing everyone continue to excel in their future careers.

 Our team has indeed made significant progress, and it's evident in our impressive code and design!

Despite the challenges we faced during Sprint 3 due to conflicting schedules, including finals and other classes, we unfortunately couldn't meet as regularly as we had hoped. It was a valuable learning experience that highlighted an area where we can improve our coordination and communication. Nevertheless, I must say that working with my team has been an absolutely fantastic experience! 

I want to give a big shoutout and kudos to Daniel for his outstanding work in formatting our website.  He has truly been an invaluable team player, always available whenever we needed him. Daniel went above and beyond in assisting us with formatting HTML pages, CSS, and various coding tasks. What's even more admirable is that he consistently provided valuable feedback and suggestions that greatly contributed to our project's success. We owe a large part of our achievements to his dedication and collaborative spirit. 

Next, let's recognize Turjo for being an exceptional team player.  His contributions have been instrumental in enhancing our project's overall quality. Turjo's valuable feedback and helpful ideas have brought fresh perspectives and helped us refine our approach.

Now, let's highlight Caleb, who has been a dependable member of our team throughout the entire project. His consistent and timely completion of tasks has been exemplary, showcasing his commitment and professionalism. Whenever Caleb encountered any issues or difficulties, he promptly reported them and sought help when needed, ensuring that we stayed on track. His significant contributions in improving our database and implementing essential methods and features have been invaluable. We appreciate your hard work, Caleb! 

Overall, I can't stress enough how fantastic it has been working with this team! Together, we have overcome challenges, made remarkable progress, and learned valuable lessons. I couldn't be prouder of our achievements, and I am genuinely excited about what the future holds for us
