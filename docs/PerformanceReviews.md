# Sprint 3

## Final Sprint Performance Review by Tridib Paul Turjo


As we approach the final stage of our project journey, it's essential to reflect on our final sprint and the overall progress we've made as a team. The final sprint brought its own set of challenges and highlights, and it's crucial to acknowledge each team member's contributions and the improvements we've collectively made.

Daniel continued to be an asset to the team during the final sprint. His expertise in HTML development and his willingness to help others was evident. However, as we neared the project deadline, Daniel experienced some anxiety and frustration, which occasionally affected his interactions with the team. Nonetheless, his sense of responsibility, teamwork, and commitment remained unwavering. He consistently assisted me when I faced challenges in understanding certain aspects of HTML, which was greatly appreciated.

Caleb maintained his exceptional level of dedication throughout the final sprint. His work on restructuring the database for improved efficiency was a significant undertaking that ultimately benefited our project. One aspect that could use improvement is that occasionally, when uploading his code, Caleb leaves behind print statements used for debugging. It's important to ensure cleaner code uploads without such remnants for smoother project maintenance.Caleb has been consistently easy to access and maintain constant communication with, which has greatly facilitated our collaborative efforts and project progress. Nevertheless, his proactive involvement and commitment to the project were consistent and valuable

Tanjeet demonstrated remarkable growth during the final sprint. His increased participation in team meetings and improved communication skills were noteworthy improvements. Unlike earlier sprints, Tanjeet was present at all meetings during this final phase, which significantly contributed to a more collaborative team dynamic. However, he could work on enhancing his documentation skills, aiming for more thorough and elaborate documentation, which would contribute significantly to our project's success.
Challenges in the final sprint included managing the last-minute feedback and making substantial changes to our documentation, such as component structure and process analysis according to feedback. Given that each team member had other courses and final exams to manage simultaneously, it was challenging to find convenient meeting times. To mitigate this, we leveraged Discord for most of our meetings, which proved to be an efficient solution. I'd like to commend everyone for their dedication and effort in completing the project amid these challenges.

In conclusion, our team has shown remarkable growth and adaptability throughout the entire project. While we faced some challenges in the final sprint, our collective efforts and determination allowed us to overcome them. I appreciate each team member's contributions, and I believe we can consider this project a success, thanks to our teamwork and commitment. I look forward to seeing everyone continue to excel in their future careers.
