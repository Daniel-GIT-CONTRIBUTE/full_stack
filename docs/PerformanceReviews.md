## Performance review by Tridib Paul Turjo

I'm delighted that we managed to meet the professor's requirements in the first sprint cycle. Initially, I had concerns 
about our project's progress, especially when everyone had plans during the midterm break, making it difficult to coordinate. 
This made me worry about our ability to complete the project on time. However, it's worth noting that we had a functional
server and a login HTML page, thanks to Daniel's contributions before the break.

Daniel, in particular, has been a valuable asset to the group. His prior knowledge of HTML, coupled with his online course 
experience, made the HTML development phase seamless. He's truly passionate about computer science, actively participating 
in group work and assisting me in resolving errors.

Caleb's dedication is truly exceptional; he invested time in mastering SQL to develop our project's database, a substantial
contribution that greatly enhanced our project's performance. Moreover, his commitment to clarifying his code thoroughly 
has helped the team better understand the SQL components of our project. His extensive effort and time spent on the project 
are indeed noteworthy.

Tanjeet's contributions to the team are commendable. He has excelled in developing app logics and is dedicated to 
maintaining our project documentation with precision. His commitment to ensuring accurate and error-free documentation is
highly valuable to the team's success.

While we haven't encountered any major issues so far, we do have occasional disagreements about implementation. However,
we've always managed to find a solution in the end. Our main challenge has been coordinating our time for collaborative work,
but I appreciate that most of our progress was achieved during our meetings. We've all put in a significant amount of effort
for this course, and I'm optimistic that we can successfully complete it.
