# Sprint 3

## Performance review by Caleb Doupe
I am very happy with how our team worked together to complete our final sprint. We went through some small wrinkles but they 
were quickly ironed out. We now have a functioning final product that we are proud to have completed together.

Daniel did a fantastic job implementing his code on the project and was a very knowledgeable source throughout the sprint, just like past sprints. 
He stayed very organized, and punctual throughout most of the project. He also displayed several leadership qualities, and did a good job keeping 
us on track. He did show some impatience during the later stage of the sprint which caused some friction, but nothing that caused any serious issues. 

Turjo continued to act as a great member in the group. He consistently kept the team on track and informed on what we still needed for our
project throughout the sprint. If he struggled on a concept, we could always rely on him to find a solution. Turjo did struggle attending our
meetings in a timely fashion during our first several meetings, which extended their length. This did improve later in the sprint, but was frustrating
in the beginning.

Tanjet was more present in our meetings this sprint which was a nice improvement. Tanjet could improve his communication skills as he 
was less vocal than the other group members. He also struggled to attend our early meetings on time. Tanjet did provide great support in a 
timely manner when asked and when it was required.
