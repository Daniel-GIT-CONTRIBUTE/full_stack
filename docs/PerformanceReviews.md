# Sprint 3
## Performance review by Daniel Cho
I am pleased working with my teammates and how the project turned out in the end.

Turjo has been a great teammate and good communicator, when we started getting slow, 
he would get us back on track be being outspoken about what we had to do.
Criticism: please update meetingnotes earlier.

Caleb has shown a deep passion and interest in learning. He is greatly motivated and responsible.
He replies back to messages immediately. He is readily available, and a great teammate!
Extremely nitpicky Criticism: Please learn how to use cloud drives like Google Drive.

Tanjet has shown imrpovements this sprint in participation. He wrote more code and actively asked out what he can help around with.
He showed a great deal of cooperation. Not in sprint3, but overall, it would be great if he could attend more meetings. He
was not very present during sprint1 and to a lesser degree during sprint2.
