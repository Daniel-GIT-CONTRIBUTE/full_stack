## Project Sprint 2 Evaluation credit, CS2005 F2023


## Team submission

Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the marker to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read. It is your responsibility to tell the marker how to find the evaluation components, it is not the marker's responsibility to hunt through the documents and code to find those items.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed
  * Other documents should be put in a documents folder in your repo and indicated in README file, if they should be read for marking assessment
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * Properly minuted SCRUM meetings and decisions (30%)
    * **0/5 points** agenda coverage for each meeting
    * **0/5 points** includes progress on agenda items suggested by prof on class diary/webpage
    * **0/5 points** decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board/issue tracker
    * **0/5 points** changes to architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented. Architecture document in docs folder
    * **0/4 points** SCRUM master and notetaker roles shared among team
    * **0/3 points** Minutes committed and pushed regularly, so team members can access.
    * **0/3 points** Features broken into tasks. Design interface/services and Coding tasks assigned to individual team members. Tasks on KanBan board.
  * Maintenance of the Kanban Board on your team github page and the issue tracker in your project repository (10%)
    * Kanban board must be set up early in the first cycle. 
    * **0/1 points** Establish labels, color coding, and categories for the Kanban board cards and issues. 
    * **0/3 points** Create cards for backlog features, required functionality for sprint 1, and assigned tasks.
    * **0/3 points** Progress of tasks noted on board
    * **0/3 points** New tasks and issues arising in meetings, reviews and otherwise are noted on kanban board
  * Performance reviews (how did the team members perform) conducted and documented (10%)
    * **0/2 points** Each team member assessed, each team member participates.
    * **0/4 points** Serious performance reviews including problems/personality clashes and possible solutions. A trivial review indicating everyone did fine will be assumed to be pro-forma and will be given no credibility.
    * **0/4 points** Problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented, and tracked with possible responses and progress on those items becoming kanban/agenda items.
  * Code reviews conducted and documented. (20 %)
    * Code should be regularly presented and discussed at SCRUM meetings, not just at end of cycle.
    * **0/3 points** Code contributions are presented to entire team.
    * **0/10 points** Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness. 
    * **0/5 points** All code should be reviewed before pull request is merged.
    * **0/2 points** Pull request deadlines established and enforced.
  * Component Architecture Document (15 %)
    * **0/5 points** Details of components and interfaces in document
    * **0/5 points** Use of diagramming and prose to concisely offer complete details
    * **0/5 points** Consistent with modules, interfaces, docstring and unit tests
  * Process Model Analysis Document (15 %)
    * **0/5 points** Elements of process identified and explained. Distinction made between process and process model.
    * **0/5 points** Changes in process since beginning of project are discussed.
    * **0/5 points** Ideas for improving process in future and what will team do about it.
