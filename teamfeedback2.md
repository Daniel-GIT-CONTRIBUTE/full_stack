## Project Sprint 2 Evaluation credit, CS2005 F2023

General Comments

* There are a few things off from the material presentation this semester. When this happens, I expect the team to explain the departure.
  * An example is unit tests - which I indicated go with each module interface, but that does not map up with modules in your arch document - are you only testing the data store and the API modules.
  * Your team doesn;t seem to have a cohesive understanding of what a component architecture is -- making interpretation of the course materials a bit difficult.
  * Architecture document was not nearly expressive enough. Seems to express confusion about the purpose of the architecture.

## Team submission

Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the marker to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read. It is your responsibility to tell the marker how to find the evaluation components, it is not the marker's responsibility to hunt through the documents and code to find those items.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed
  * Other documents should be put in a documents folder in your repo and indicated in README file, if they should be read for marking assessment
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * Properly minuted SCRUM meetings and decisions (30%)
    * **5/5 points** agenda coverage for each meeting
    * **5/5 points** includes progress on agenda items suggested by prof on class diary/webpage
    * **5/5 points** decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board/issue tracker
    * **3/5 points** changes to architecture and low level designs (interfaces) discussed, determined, and documented. Architecture document in docs folder
      * Some what. But your changes now seem to exclusively be discussion of code, not architecture considerations.
    * **4/4 points** SCRUM master and notetaker roles shared among team
      * could be better balance.
    * **3/3 points** Minutes committed and pushed regularly, so team members can access.
    * **2/3 points** Features broken into tasks. Design interface/services and Coding tasks assigned to individual team members. Tasks on KanBan board.
      * I would prefer you be more specific about this.
  * Maintenance of the Kanban Board on your team github page and the issue tracker in your project repository (10%)
    * Kanban board must be set up early in the first cycle. 
    * **1/1 points** Establish labels, color coding, and categories for the Kanban board cards and issues. 
    * **2/3 points** Create cards for backlog features, required functionality for sprint 1, and assigned tasks.
      * No backlog ideas? No ideas for future features?
    * **3/3 points** Progress of tasks noted on board
    * **2/3 points** New tasks and issues arising in meetings, reviews and otherwise are noted on kanban board
      * Mostly there, but I expect to items from perf reviews as well. 
  * Performance reviews (how did the team members perform) conducted and documented (10%)
    * **2/2 points** Each team member assessed, each team member participates.
    * **2/4 points** Serious performance reviews including problems/personality clashes and possible solutions. A trivial review indicating everyone did fine will be assumed to be pro-forma and will be given no credibility.
      * I did indicate your needed to dig deeper to suggest improvements team members could make, but the entries seems to be a lot of praise. 
    * **1/4 points** Problems with the team progress, dynamics and process must be identified and documented, and tracked with possible responses and progress on those items becoming kanban/agenda items.
      * If you're not going allow critical assessment, it's hard to come up with suggestions.
  * Code reviews conducted and documented. (20 %)
    * Code should be regularly presented and discussed at SCRUM meetings, not just at end of cycle.
    * **3/3 points** Code contributions are presented to entire team.
      * Not clear what your policy is, but seems to be done between meets and PRs. Please clarify.
    * **7/10 points** Code reviews are thorough, covering style issues (SOLID, de-coupling) as well as correctness. 
      * without unit test coverage of modules, regression testing is not possible. You do mention some of the principles.
    * **5/5 points** All code should be reviewed before pull request is merged.
    * **1/2 points** Pull request deadlines established and enforced.
      * Was it set to Nov 8? And then you changed it? Bit confused here.
  * Component Architecture Document (15 %)
    * **3/5 points** Details of components and interfaces in document
      * Its a single confusing document. Routing is in it twice? What do the colors mean?
    * **2/5 points** Use of diagramming and prose to concisely offer complete details
      * The document seems to be a single diagram. So module interfaces are NOT depicted. And how about some prose to explain it to me. What are you trying to illustrate here?
    * **0/5 points** Consistent with modules, interfaces, docstring and unit tests
      * You have to depict the interfaces for me to assess this.
  * Process Model Analysis Document (15 %)
    * **4/5 points** Elements of process identified and explained. Distinction made between process and process model.
      * Very elaborate (maybe a bit too complex?) but seems to incorporate tasks, not just process elements, so parts of it may be too low level.
      * I don't think you distinguish process model from process from tasks.
    * **5/5 points** Changes in process since beginning of project are discussed.
      * Good reflection on problems, even if it is not strictly process model issues.
    * **3/5 points** Ideas for improving process in future and what will team do about it.
      * I think this just devolved into problems you were having, for example how is difficulty using github part of your process model?

* **73/100 points** TOTAL
